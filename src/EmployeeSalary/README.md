### **Calculate a Employee's Yearly Salary**

In this challenge, you will implement a function that calculates an
employee’s yearly salary. Your inputs will be how many hours the
employee works per week and how much they make per hour. The output will
be the employee’s yearly salary. We’ll be looking at the employee’s
gross income for this particular job, so there’s no need to worry about
taxes or 401k savings or any of that. This is just the total amount
earned by the employee.
