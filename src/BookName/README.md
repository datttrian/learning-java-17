### **Create a Book**

It’s time to test your knowledge of classes and instances with a coding
challenge. Be sure to use what you’ve learned so far about the different
parts of a class and how to create and use instances.

 

**Your task**: Implement a class that represents a book with a
name. Then, implement the getter** **method so the book name can be
retrieved after the book is created.

### **Example 1:**

Input: Book with name `Best Software Developer Tips`

Result: `Best Software Developer Tips`
